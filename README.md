# Concept

Basically, I want to generate all possible code snippet highlight. If it is possible I want to generate the code snippet for only what speakers want. However the difficulty is if speaker made mistake or want to change the code after generating all slides, he/she need to redo whole generating processes. This plugin is for easy-to-regenerate.
